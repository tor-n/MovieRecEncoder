**Transformer Encoder for Movie Recommendation Task** <br>
In this work, we use the transformer encoder in a movie recommendation task. While common approaches to the recommendation task is to either rely on matrix factorization techniques or information from the movie sequence, the main idea of this work is to design an incorporation of heterogeneous features of users and movies into the model.
